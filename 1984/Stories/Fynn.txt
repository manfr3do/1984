PART 2 
Story :                     A figure in blue overalls was coming down
                            the pavement, not ten metres away. It was the girl from the
                            Fiction Department, the girl with dark hair. The light was
                            failing, but there was no difficulty in recognizing her. She
                            looked him straight in the face, then walked quickly on as
                            though she had not seen him.
                            She must have followed him here. 
                            Maybe she is a agent of the Thought Police, or simply an amateur spy
                            actuated by officiousness, hardly mattered. It was enough
                            that she was watching him. Probably she had seen him go
                            into the pub as well.
                            Then the spasm passed, leaving a dull ache behind.
                            for several seconds wondering vaguely what to do, then
                            turned round and began to retrace his steps. As he turned
                            it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him three
                            minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch
                            up with her. He could keep on her track till they were in
                            some quiet place, and then smash her skull in with a cobblestone.
                            The piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy
                            enough for the job.

<<<Question:                For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move. should Winston

                            they found a piece of glass near the dead body, and asked people in the area if they had seen anything. They also question Mr. Charrington, who recognizes the piece of glass and puts them on your trail.
 
            SSSSQuestion:   Winston had to decide, should he try to leave the city or should he

WWWWWwalk 1 ComformPoint :  Winston walks futher, he turned to the right and walked heavily away, not
                            noticing for the moment that he was going in the wrong
                            direction. At any rate, one question was settled. There was
                            no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him. 
                            He thought also of hurrying to the Community Centre and
                            staying there till the place closed, so as to establish a partial
                            alibi for the evening. But that too was impossible. A deadly
                            lassitude had taken hold of him. All he wanted was to get
                            home quickly and then sit down and be quiet.

                            You´re home again, you went into the kitchen and swallow nearly
                            a teacupful of Victory Gin. You went to the tabel and took the diary out of the drawer, but you did not open it, you only stare at the cover of the book and trying without succes to shut the voice out if his consciousness.

                            It was the middle of the morning, and Winston had left the cubicle to go 
                            to the lavatory.
                            A solitary figure was coming towards him from the other end of the long, brightly-lit corridor. It was the girl with
                            dark hair. Four days had gone past since the evening when
                            he had run into her outside the junk-shop. As she came
                            nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling, not noticeable at a distance because it was of the same colour as her
                            overalls. Probably she had crushed her hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the plots
                            of novels were ‘roughed in’. It was a common accident in the
                            Fiction Department.
                            They were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled and fell almost flat on her face. A sharp cry of pain was
                            wrung out of her. She must have fallen right on the injured arm.
                            ...In front of
                            him was an enemy who was trying to kill him: in front of
                            him, also, was a human creature, in pain and perhaps with
                            a broken bone.

<<<<Question :              Would Winston help her up or go futher?

HHHHHelp 1 Conformpoint:    ‘You haven’t broken anything?’
                            ‘No, I’m all right. It hurt for a moment, that’s all.’
                            She held out her free hand to him, and he helped her up.
                            She had regained some of her colour, and appeared very
                            much better.
                            ‘It’s nothing,’ she repeated shortly. ‘I only gave my wrist a
                            bit of a bang. Thanks, comrade!’
                            And with that she walked on in the direction in which
                            she had been going, as briskly as though it had really been
                            nothing. in the two or three seconds while he was helping her up
                            the girl had slipped something into his hand. She gives you a fragment of paper.

                            It was a physical problem that had to be solved: how to
                            get in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting.
