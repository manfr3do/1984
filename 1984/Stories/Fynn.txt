PART 2 
>>>Suddenly his heart seemed to turn to ice and his bowels to water.
 A figure in blue overalls was coming down
 the pavement, not ten metres away. It was the girl from the
 Fiction Department, the girl with dark hair. The light was
 failing, but there was no difficulty in recognizing her. She
 looked him straight in the face, then walked quickly on as
 though she had not seen him.
 For a few seconds Winston was too paralysed to move.
 Then he turned to the right and walked heavily away, not
 noticing for the moment that he was going in the wrong
 direction. At any rate, one question was settled. There was
 no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him. She
 must have followed him here, because it was not credible
 that by pure chance she should have happened to be walking 
 on the same evening up the same obscure backstreet,
 kilometres distant from any quarter where Party members
 lived. It was too great a coincidence. Whether she was really
 an agent of the Thought Police, or simply an amateur spy
 actuated by officiousness, hardly mattered. It was enough
 that she was watching him. Probably she had seen him go
 into the pub as well.
 It was an effort to walk. The lump of glass in his pocket
 banged against his thigh at each step, and he was half minded 
 to take it out and throw it away. The worst thing was the
 pain in his belly. For a couple of minutes he had the feeling
 that he would die if he did not reach a lavatory soon. But
 there would be no public lavatories in a quarter like this.
 Then the spasm passed, leaving a dull ache behind.
 for several seconds wondering vaguely what to do, then
 turned round and began to retrace his steps. As he turned
 it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him three
 minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch
 up with her. He could keep on her track till they were in
 some quiet place, and then smash her skull in with a cobblestone.
 The piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy
 enough for the job. But he abandoned the idea immediately,
 because even the thought of making any physical effort was
 unbearable. He could not run, he could not strike a blow.
 Besides, she was young and lusty and would defend herself:::Page 127/128

                            While you go home, the dead women was found by the thought police...
                            they found a piece of glass near the dead body, and asked people in the area if they had seen anything. They also question Mr. Charrington, who recognizes the piece of glass and puts them on your trail.
            SSSSQuestion:   Winston had to decide, should he try to leave the city or should he      
                            wait and see what happens. (Leave/Wait)

WWWWWwalk 1 ComformPoint :  Winston walks futher, he turned to the right and walked heavily away, not
                            noticing for the moment that he was going in the wrong
                            direction. At any rate, one question was settled. There was
                            no doubting any longer that the girl was spying on him. 
                            He thought also of hurrying to the Community Centre and
                            staying there till the place closed, so as to establish a partial
                            alibi for the evening. But that too was impossible. A deadly
                            lassitude had taken hold of him. All he wanted was to get
                            home quickly and then sit down and be quiet.

                            YouÂ´re home again, you went into the kitchen and swallow nearly
                            a teacupful of Victory Gin. You went to the tabel and took the diary out of the drawer, but you did not open it, you only stare at the cover of the book and trying without succes to shut the voice out if his consciousness.
